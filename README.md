## WHAT IS Up&Run

You are an Administrator and you get new iMacs? All Macs should have the same applications and settings?

Just use UpAndRun and use your time more effectively.


## BACKGROUND

Up&Run is a helper to automate the setup of your Mac. I use it to give me more time for more exciting stuff.

Up&Run is basicly just a bit Bash and Ansible. It works but is still under development and beta.

Up&Run is doing...

* installing Applciations http://caskroom.io/
* installing Brews http://brew.sh/
* changing Mac OS X settings like reduce transparency or change Dock icon size


## INSTRUCTIONS

Edit **upandrun/playbook.yml** in a way that only your required applications and tools are listed. Check http://caskroom.io/search to find more of your applications.

Just run **./run.sh** in your Terminal and lean back. Coffee time.
